{name: "Santiago Bernabeu",description: "The Santiago Bernabéu Stadium is a football stadium in Madrid, Spain. With a current seating capacity of 81,044, it has been the home stadium of Real Madrid since its completion in 1947. The Santiago Bernabéu is one of the world`s most famous football venues. It has hosted the final of the European Cup/UEFA Champions League on four occasions: in 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 and hosted the second leg of the 2018 Copa Libertadores Final. The final matches for the 1964 European Nations` Cup and the 1982 FIFA World Cup, were also held at the Bernabéu, making it the first stadium in Europe to host both a UEFA European Championship, a FIFA World Cup final and a Copa Libertadores final. On 22 June 1944, the Banco Mercantil e Industrial bank granted a credit to Santiago Bernabéu and Rafael Salgado for the purchase of the land adjacent to the old Ramin Amin. On 5 September 1944, architects Manuel Muñoz Monasterio and Luis Alemany Soler were hired and the structure on the site began to give way to the new stadium. On 27 October 1944, construction work on the stadium began. The Nuevo Estadio Chamartín (English: New Chamartín Stadium) was inaugurated on 14 December 1947 with a match between Real Madrid and the Portuguese side Os Belenenses, which resulted in a 3–1 victory for Los Blancos. The stadium had an initial capacity of 75,145 spectators, 27,645 of which had seats (7,125 covered) and 47,500 for standing fans. Sabino Barinaga was the first player to score in the new stadium.",img_src: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Estadio_Santiago_Bernab%C3%A9u-Grada_norte.jpg",profile_img: "https://www.mhapartments.com/assets/img/city/casino-tour-madrid-41.jpg",url: "Santiago-Bernabeu",},
{name: "San Siro",description: "The Giuseppe Meazza Stadium, commonly known as San Siro, is a football stadium in the San Siro district of Milan, Italy, which is the home of the AC Milan and Internazionale. It has a seating capacity of 80,018, making it one of the largest stadiums in Europe, and the largest in Italy. On 3 March 1980, the stadium was named in honour of Giuseppe Meazza, the two-time World Cup winner (1934, 1938) who played for Inter and briefly for Milan in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. The San Siro is a UEFA category four stadium. It hosted six games at the 1990 FIFA World Cup and four European Cup finals, in 1965, 1970, 2001 and 2016. Construction of the stadium commenced in 1925 in the district of Milan named San Siro, with the new stadium originally named Nuovo Stadio Calcistico San Siro (San Siro New Football Stadium). The idea to build a stadium in the same district as the horse racing track belonged to the president of A.C. Milan at the time, Piero Pirelli. The architects designed a private stadium only for football, without athletics tracks which characterized Italian stadiums built with public funds. The inauguration was on 19 September 1926, when 35,000 spectators saw Inter defeat Milan 6–3. Originally, the ground was home and property of A.C. Milan. Finally, in 1947, Inter, who used to play in the Arena Civica downtown, became tenants and the two have shared the ground ever since. From 1948 to 1955, engineers Armando Ronca and Ferruccio Calzolari developed the project for the second extension of the stadium, which was meant to increase the capacity from 50,000 to 150,000 visitors. Calzolari and Ronca proposed three additional, vertically arranged, rings of spectator rows. Nineteen spiralling ramps – each 200 metres long – gave access to the upper tiers. During construction, the realisation of the highest of the three rings was abandoned and the number of visitors limited to 100,000. On 2 March 1980 the stadium was named for Giuseppe Meazza (1910–1979), one of the most famous Milanese footballers. Two Milan derby Champions League knockout ties have taken place at San Siro, in 2003 and 2005, with A.C. Milan winning both matches. The reaction of Inter`s fans to impending defeat in the latter match (throwing flares and other objects at Milan players and forcing the match to be abandoned) earned the club a large fine and a four-game ban on spectators attending European fixtures there the following season. Apart from being used by Milan and Inter, the Italian national team occasionally plays games there. It has also been used for the European Cup finals of 1965 (won by Inter), 1970 (won by Feyenoord), and the UEFA Champions League finals of 2001 (won by FC Bayern Munich) and 2016 (won by Real Madrid).",img_src: "https://media.timeout.com/images/105121340/image.jpg",profile_img: "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/Destinations/Europe/Italy/Milan/milan-cathedral-italy.jpg",url: "San-Siro",},
{name: "Camp Nou",description: "Camp Nou, meaning new field, often referred to in English as the Nou Camp) is the home stadium of FC Barcelona since its completion in 1957. With a seating capacity of 99,354, it is the largest stadium in Spain and Europe, and the third largest football stadium in the world in capacity. It has hosted two European Cup/Champions League finals in 1989 and 1999, two UEFA Cup Winners` Cup finals, four Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final games, five UEFA Super Cup final games, four Copa del Rey finals, two Copa de la Liga final games, twenty-one Supercopa de España final games, five matches including the opening game of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, two out of four matches at the 1964 European Nations` Cup and the football competition final at the 1992 Summer Olympics. The stadium`s capacity has varied greatly over the years, opening at 106,146, but growing to 121,401 for the 1982 FIFA World Cup. Apart from hosting Barcelona, Camp Nou is home to the Catalan team. The stadium is frequently used for other football events. The European Cup final between Milan and Steaua București was held on 24 May 1989, with the Italian club winning 4–0. Camp Nou hosted part of the football competition, including the final, in the 1992 Summer Olympics. In preparation for these matches, two additional tiers of seating were installed over the previous roof-line. Camp Nou underwent little change after 1982, except for the opening of the club museum in 1984. The stadium underwent a facelift in 1993–94, in which the pitch was lowered by 2.5 metres (8 feet), the security gap that separated the lawn from the galleries was removed, and standing room was eliminated in favor of individual seating. A new press box, renovation of the presidential grandstand and boxes, new parking under the main grandstand, and new lighting and sound systems were completed in time for the 1998–99 season. In 1999, UEFA outlawed standing sections in stadiums, and Camp Nou`s capacity settled to its current level. The stadium hosted the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final later that year where Manchester United played Bayern Munich. United won 2–1, coming back from 0–1 down in injury time. During 1998–99, UEFA rated Camp Nou a five-star stadium for its services and functionalities. In 2000, fans were polled concerning the stadium`s name. Of the 29,102 votes the club received, a total of 19,861 (68.25%) preferred Camp Nou to Estadi del FC Barcelona, and thus the official name was changed to the popular nickname.",img_src: "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*rpZ2K8Y3HYhJcGw4KLrz8g.jpeg",profile_img: "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/02/05/19/AbroadBarcelonaHKGPXD.jpg",url: "Camp-Nou",},
{name: "Anfield",description: "Anfield is a football stadium in Anfield, Liverpool, England, which has a seating capacity of 54,074, making it the sixth largest football stadium in England. It has been the home of Liverpool FC since their formation in 1892. It was originally the home of Everton FC from 1884 to 1891, before they moved to Goodison Park after a dispute with the club president. The stadium has four stands: the Spion Kop, the Main Stand, the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand and the Anfield Road End. The record attendance of 61,905 was set at a match between Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1952. The ground converted to an all-seater stadium in 1994 as a result of the Taylor Report, which reduced its capacity. Two gates at the stadium are named after former Liverpool managers: Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley. A statue of Shankly is also outside the stadium. The ground is 2 miles (3 km) from Liverpool Lime Street railway station. It was proposed in 2002 to replace the stadium with a new one in the adjacent Stanley Park, but after the acquisition of Liverpool F.C. by Fenway Sports Group in 2010 it was made clear this would not happen. Construction for an extension to the Main Stand began on 8 December 2014. This extension increased the stadium capacity to 54,074, making it one of the largest all-seater single stands in European football. There are future plans to expand the Anfield Road Stand which would bring the stadium size to around 61,000.

{name: "Allianz Stadium",description: "Juventus Stadium, known for sponsorship reasons as the Allianz Stadium since July 2017, sometimes simply known in Italy as the Stadium, is an all-seater football stadium in the Vallette borough of Turin, Italy, and the home of Juventus F.C. The stadium was built on the site of Juventus` and Torino`s former home, the Stadio delle Alpi, and is one of only four club-owned football stadiums in Serie A, alongside Sassuolo`s Mapei Stadium, Udinese`s Stadio Friuli, and Atalanta B.C.‘s stadium. It was opened at the start of the 2011–12 season and has a capacity of just over 41,000 spectators. Juventus played the first match in the stadium on 8 September 2011 against the world`s oldest professional football club Notts County, on 8 September 2011 in a friendly which ended 1–1; Luca Toni scored the first goal. The first competitive match was against Parma three days later, where Stephan Lichtsteiner scored the stadium`s first competitive goal in the 16th minute. Juventus only lost three matches of their first 100 Italian top-flight league matches at the Juventus Stadium. Juventus` previous permanent home ground, the Stadio delle Alpi, was completed in 1990 to host matches for the 1990 World Cup. The club`s move from their previous ancestral home, the Stadio Comunale, to the Stadio delle Alpi was controversial. The new stadium was built at a great expense, was relatively less accessible, and had poor sightlines due to the athletics track. Despite Juventus being the best-supported team in Italy (with the highest television subscribers and away section attendances), attendance at the Stadio delle Alpi was dismal. Average attendance was only a third of the stadium`s 67,000 capacity. The club bought the stadium from the local council in 2002, a decision which was popular with fans. Then, Antonio Giraudo (CEO of the Club between 1994 and 2006) committed the project to the architect Gino Zavanella: the initial project already includes features that will be typical of the final version, such as nearly halving the oversized capacity of the Delle Alpi and the elimination of the athletics track. Juventus moved out of the unpopular stadium in 2006 and began plans to build a more intimate and atmospheric venue. During that period, they played their matches at the newly renovated Stadio Olimpico, which was also unpopular due to its low capacity. In November 2008, the club unveiled plans for a new 41,000-seater stadium on the site of the Stadio delle Alpi. The new stadium, built at a cost of €155 million, features modern executive boxes, among other new developments. The completion of Juventus Stadium made Juventus the only Serie A club to build and own their stadium at the time. Then-club chairman Giovanni Cobolli Gigli described the stadium as `a source of great pride`. The financing of the project was contributed by the advanced payment from Sportfive for €35 million, a loan of €50 million (later increased to €60 million) from Istituto per il Credito Sportivo, and a land sales to Nordiconad for €20.25 million.",img_src: "https://www.mymotherlode.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/30PNjo.jpg",profile_img: "https://globeevents.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/turin.jpg",url: "Allianz-Stadium",},

Widely known for its exterior of inflated ETFE plastic panels, it is the first stadium in the world with a full colour changing exterior. Located at 25 Werner-Heisenberg-Allee at the northern edge of Munich`s Schwabing-Freimann borough on the Fröttmaning Heath, it is the second-largest arena in Germany behind Westfalenstadion in Dortmund. FC Bayern Munich has played its home games at the Allianz Arena since the start of the 2005–06 season. The club had previously played their home games at the Munich Olympic Stadium since 1972. 1860 Munich previously had a 50% share in the stadium, but Bayern Munich purchased their shares for €11 million in April 2006. The arrangement allowed 1860 Munich to play at the stadium while retaining no ownership until 2025. However, in July 2017 the rental contract was terminated, making Bayern Munich the sole tenants of the stadium. The large financial services provider Allianz purchased the naming rights to the stadium for 30 years. However, this name cannot be used when hosting FIFA and UEFA events, since these governing bodies have policies forbidding corporate sponsorship from companies that are not official tournament partners. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the stadium was referred to as FIFA WM-Stadion München (FIFA World Cup Stadium, Munich). In UEFA club and Nations League matches, it is known as Fußball Arena München (Football Arena Munich), and it hosted the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final.

It is about 0.5 miles (800 m) from Old Trafford Cricket Ground and the adjacent tram stop. Nicknamed `The Theatre of Dreams` by Bobby Charlton, Old Trafford has been United`s home ground since 1910, although from 1941 to 1949 the club shared Maine Road with local rivals Manchester City as a result of Second World War bomb damage. Old Trafford underwent several expansions in the 1990s, and 2000s, including the addition of extra tiers to the North, West and East Stands, almost returning the stadium to its original capacity of 80,000. Future expansion is likely to involve the addition of a second tier to the South Stand, which would raise the capacity to around 88,000.

In front a crowd of 25,000, HSV lost 2–3. At the time the stadium was also known as Altonaer Stadion, however it was not the home ground of FC Altona 93 (it was Adolf-Jäger-Kampfbahn). Altona was a large club of Germany that has long been surpassed by HSV. After a long break the stadium was finally renovated. Between 1951 and 1953 the stadium was rebuilt. On 12 July the stadium was opened as Volksparkstadion (The People`s Park Stadium), named after its location at Altona Volkspark (People`s Park). Most of the building materials came from the ruins of Eimsbüttel, a district of Hamburg destroyed under Allied bombing. The new stadium could hold up to 75,000 and continued to be used for the various sporting events of the city. In 1963, when HSV qualified for the newly created Bundesliga, they moved into the Volksparkstadion, a stadium that was both larger and more modern than Rothenbaum. At this time, FC Altona missed out on the opportunity and has struggled ever since. HSV then began to see some success in the Bundesliga and managed to maintain their status for years to come. HSV won titles in 1979, 1982 and 1983. The stadium is a UEFA Elite stadium which makes it eligible it to host UEFA Europa League and UEFA Champions League finals. A large clock was added to the northwest corner in 2001 to commemorate HSV`s status as the only club to have played continuously in the Bundesliga since its foundation. The clock marks the time, down to the second, since the league was founded on 24 August 1963. However, after Hamburg`s relegation to the 2nd tier, it has been updated to reflect HSV`s foundation. In 2001 AOL bought the naming rights to the Volksparkstadion for €15.3 million, retitling the ground as the AOL Arena. In March 2007 the HSH Nordbank bought the naming rights for €25 million, and the stadium was rebranded as the `HSH Nordbank Arena` in a six-year deal. From July 2010 the arena was called the Imtech Arena, after Imtech bought the naming rights. After Imtech`s sponsorship ended in June 2015, the stadium reverted to its original name of Volksparkstadion. Due to UEFA regulations, when the stadium had a sponsored name it was referred to as the Hamburg Arena for European matches.",img_src: "https://aviewfrommyseat.co.uk/photos/anonymous-20151226104940.jpg",profile_img: "https://www.cunard.com/content/dam/cunard/inventory-assets/ports/HAM/HAM.jpg.image.0.0.low.jpg",url: "Volksparkstadion",},
{name: "The City Ground",description: "The City Ground is a football stadium in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, England, on the banks of the River Trent. It has been home to Nottingham Forest Football Club since 1898, and has 30,445 seats. The stadium was a venue when England hosted Euro 96, and is only three hundred yards away from Meadow Lane, home of Forest`s neighbouring club Notts County; the two grounds are the closest professional football stadiums in England and the second-closest in the United Kingdom after the grounds of Dundee and Dundee United. They are located on opposite sides of the River Trent. Nottingham Forest moved to their new ground on 3 September 1898 – 33 years after their formation and six years after election to the Football League. To raise the £3,000 required to finance the move the club asked members, supporters and businessmen to subscribe to `New Ground Scheme` bearer bonds which cost £5 each. Over £2,000 was raised this way. The new ground was called the City Ground. It was only a few hundred yards from the old Town Ground at the opposite end of Trent Bridge, which had been named after the Town Arms pub. Nottingham was granted its Charter as a City in 1897 and it was called the City Ground to commemorate this as the land on which it stands was at that time within the City boundary. In 1952 boundary changes resulted in the ground coming under the local council of West Bridgford rather than the City. Opposite the City Ground, still within the City boundaries, lies Meadow Lane, home of Notts County. The City Ground was wide open on three sides with no protection from the weather but the pitch was one of the finest in the country. This was due to the presence on the committee of J. W. Bardill, a nurseryman whose family firm still exists in Stapleford near Nottingham and whose company was given the task of preparing the pitch. In 1935, the club had the opportunity to buy the ground from Nottingham Corporation for £7,000 but they declined. On 12 October 1957, a new East Stand opened at the City Ground costing £40,000 and having benches to sit up to 2,500 fans. The visitors for the opening were Manchester United’s `Busby Babes`, just four months before eight of them died in the Munich air disaster. A new record attendance of 49,946 was set in October 1967 when Forest beat Manchester Utd 3-1 in a First Division fixture, five months after Forest had finished second to United in the league. On 11 September 1961, the floodlights at the ground were officially turned on for the first time as Forest faced Gillingham in the League Cup. The Main Stand was largely rebuilt in 1965 but on 24 August 1968 fire broke out during a First Division game against Leeds United. The stand was damaged by fire but thankfully, despite a crowd of 31,126, there were no injuries among the crowd. The fire started in the boiler room, just before half-time. The only reported injuries was to the television crew on the TV gantry who had to climb down from the gantry as the ladder was stored in the boiler house and the ladder was the only way up or down, the gantry was extended the length of the stand and now has access at both ends. As a result, Forest played six `home` matches at nearby Meadow Lane and did not win one of them. Sadly many of the club`s records, trophies, memorabilia etc. were lost in the fire. The stand was refurbished. In December 1967 the City Ground was host to an England U23 match against Italy.",img_src: "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0d/b0/b0/0db0b0a386a09f62d83839f39b7d19bd.jpg",profile_img: "https://thelawyer.imgix.net/content/uploads/2018/12/07164833/iStock-532163450.jpg",url: "The-City-Ground",},
