    {name: "Patricio Rui",description: "Rui Pedro dos Santos Patrício is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for English club Wolverhampton Wanderers and the Portugal national team. Before moving to England, he spent most of his career with Sporting CP, making his debut with the first team at only 18 and going on to appear in 467 official games. He won five trophies during his 12-year spell there, including two Portuguese Cups. Patrício earned his first cap for Portugal in 2010, after Paulo Bento`s appointment as head coach. He represented the nation in two World Cups and three European Championships, winning the 2016 edition of the latter tournament. Patrício was included in Bento's 23-man squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup as first-choice, and made his debut in the competition in the first encounter against Germany, which ended with a 0–4 loss. He missed the second game against the United States, due to injury. Patrício appeared in his 50th international on 30 June 2016, during Euro 2016: after the 1–1 draw to Poland at the Stade Vélodrome during the first 120 minutes, he saved Jakub Błaszczykowski's attempt in a 5–3 penalty shootout win that qualified to the semi-finals. Having won the tournament with a solid display in the final, he also made the squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.",img_src: "https://premierleague-static-files.s3.amazonaws.com/premierleague/photos/players/250x250/p38533.png",profile_img: "https://foxsports1340am.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000428799906-1.jpg",url: "Patricio-Rui",},
